Similar to how Expedia, Kayak, and Trivago are used for travel; prices and availability for veterinary supplies differ from vendor to vendor. Vetcove allows veterinary practices to compare prices, what’s in stock, and order from all their vendors in one website/mobile app. Vetcove launched in 2015 and already more than half of the veterinary practices nationwide actively use it to help streamline their ordering process while saving money at the same time.\r\n\r\nOur summer sales internship program is structured to mimic a real sales environment where expectations are clearly defined, performance is measured by actual results, and additional compensation can be earned by achieving recurring goals/targets. Your job will be to conduct proactive outreach to veterinary practices in order to book demos (Zoom screen shares) with potential users. Most of this proactive outreach is by calling veterinary practices coupled with 1-to-1 emails as well.\r\n\r\nThe ideal candidate is someone who is not only interested in sales but ideally has experience with any of the following:\r\nMaking outbound cold calls\r\nWorking in a sales environment\r\nWorking in a B2B (business-to-business) setting\r\n\r\nIn addition to the experience above, candidates will ideally have the following:\r\nPrevious experience working in an independent or remote role\r\nExperience using a CRM (Hubspot, Salesforce, etc.)\r\nAbility to work under pressure\r\nAbility to work independently\r\nExceptional time management skills\r\nConfidence in talking to individuals outside of the organization\r\n\r\nCompensation: $15/hour + monthly bonus and commission\r\n\r\nLocation: Fully Remote\r\n\r\nDuration: Summer\r\n\r\nSchedule: Flexible, ideally 25+ hours per week over the summer. Opportunity to continue working in the same or different capacity in the Fall based on performance, organizational needs and goals\r\n",

              "description":"Hi, I’m Rui and I’m the Co-Founder and Chief Clinical Officer of MedMe. I’m a pharmacist, and despite a $200k Doctor of Pharmacy degree, I still spend most of my time writing notes by hand and fielding phone calls for refills. When in fact, pharmacists can directly prescribe meds (like birth control), adjust diabetes/heart medications, give over 20 different vaccines/injections, and much more!\r\n\r\nI was almost ready to leave my profession when I met my co-founders Purya & Nick. Purya was a health data scientist for the government and Nick a product engineer for the Tesla Roadster. They’d watched their own parents struggle with managing 10+ medications and were equally passionate about using pharmacists to provide more services for patients in the community.\r\n\r\nTogether, we identified the biggest problem to be existing pharmacy software built 20 years ago with the primary purpose to sell drugs. So, we built MedMe.\r\n\r\nWe are building software for an industry that has relied on paper and pen for a long time. This is why crafting, building, and constantly improving the end-to-end customer experience is an essential part of our company. It’s crucial that we listen deeply to the diverse needs of our pharmacies - located anywhere from dense urban jungles to northern remote communities - to design and build for their needs to ultimately provide more proactive and sustainable care for the patients in their communities.\r\n\r\n**Our mission**\r\n\r\nMedMe is building the operating system to transform pharmacies into community health hubs. Pharmacies are increasingly doing more than just selling drugs, offering services like vaccinations, prescribing meds, and blood tests. MedMe Health builds software that helps schedule, document, and manage these services at scale. \r\n\r\nOur clients include the two largest pharmacy chains in Canada, servicing coast-to-coast in 3500+ pharmacies across 10 provinces, serving millions of patients.\r\n\r\n**The opportunity**\r\n\r\n- Building web applications using React and NodeJS (both in Typescript) using GraphQL and a Postgres database on AWS infrastructure\r\n- Collaborating on key technology decisions to shape the architecture and product roadmap\r\n- Sharing your depth and breadth of knowledge through peer mentorship\r\n- Taking an active role in developing our team and maintaining a quality codebase through code reviews, sprint planning, and retrospectives\r\n- Working with code and project management tools such as JIRA/Notion/Figma\r\n\r\nAs an example, here are some projects you could expect to work on:\r\n\r\n- Creating new patient and pharmacist flows (eg. intakes, modules, features) to meet the needs of both our national enterprises and mom-and-pop pharmacy partners\r\n- Scaling our test environments using the AWS CDK (IaC)\r\n- Working with 3rd party digital health platforms (eg. EHRs/pharmacy software, remote monitoring devices) to facilitate integration and data interoperability that allows pharmacists to deliver more personalized, proactive care\r\n- Building & versioning APIs that are consumed by third parties\r\n\r\n\r\n**Your tech stack**\r\n\r\n- React 17+\r\n- Node.js/Typescript with GraphQL\r\n- PostgreSQL\r\n- AWS infrastructure (CDK or Terraform a plus)\r\n- Typescript (both frontend and backend)\r\n- Dockerized / Container Infrastructure\r\n- Github & Github actions\r\n- Slack & Giphy & Tenor (Our gif game is strong)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What you bring to the table**\r\n\r\n- You are an experienced full-stack engineer with more than a few years of experience.\r\n- You are a team player and you enjoy working with your fellow team members to work through the ideas, problems, \r\n- You have a growth mindset and you seek out opportunities to grow.\r\n- Your communication style is open, concise, and effective; you can easily explain technical to non-technical parties.\r\n- You care about the product and about the end-user. \r\n- You are a process-builder; we enjoy working with engineers who are ready to help improve our processes and make them more scalable. \r\n\r\nDon’t sweat it if you don’t have everything listed above. We believe in growth and curiosity. If you have some of these qualities and are excited about this opportunity, then we want to hear from you!\r\n\r\n**How We Hire**\r\n\r\nMedMe is committed to a fair and equitable hiring process for all candidates. To ensure that each candidate’s journey is consistent and the selection process is unbiased, the team at MedMe will not be responding to any personal messages regarding this role or other opportunities.\r\n\r\nFollowing the advice of Canadian health authorities, to mitigate the risk of potential spread of COVID-19 and support social distancing, all recruiting activities including interviews and new hire on-boarding will be conducted virtually. \r\n\r\n**Annual Salary ranges from $90,000 - $140,000 CAD + stock options**\r\n\r\n**Perks at MedMe**\r\n\r\n- Flexible health benefit plan \r\n- Full dental, vision, physical &amp; mental health plus health spending account\r\n- Performance development support (yearly budget for courses &amp; conferences)\r\n\r\n**Location**\r\n\r\nWe are fully remote in Canada, however, we like to plan on-site team retreats! \r\n\r\n-------\r\nMedMe is a proud equal opportunity workplace that is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status.
